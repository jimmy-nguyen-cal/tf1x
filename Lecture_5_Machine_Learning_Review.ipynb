    "    - is about solving problems by analyzing data already present in datasets / databases \n",
    "    - In data mining, the data is stored electronically, and the search is automated \n",
    "    - Data mining is a topic that involves learning in a practical, nontheoretical sense\n",
    "    - It is about finding and describing previously unknown patterns in data \n",
    "    - The output may include a description of a structure that can be used to classify unknown examples\n",
